# The Capstone Project

The last week of the program is capstone week!

During this week, students will be given the opportunity to learn a new skill and/or build upon your existing skills in the form of a capstone project. 

That said, you will be given two options in order to pursue your capstone project: 

- **Option A: Capstone Modules on MyGA**
- **Option B: Building a new Project using a new tech Stack/technology or deeper discovery of existing skill**

## Option A: Capstone modules on MyGA:

To better prepare students for specific career paths, GA has produced several, week-long, self-guided capstone modules. These modules, hosted on the myGA learning platform, direct students through independent study of a sub-field of Software Engineering, culminating in a project with specific requirements. 

All projects involve refactoring or adding new features to a previous, existing application, and are timed to include both learning and project completion within a week of full-time study.

**There are two intended use cases for these modules:**

1. Students can choose to complete the capstone module project as their final, capstone project during the course. 

2. The modules are designed to be completed within a week, so students would begin the module at the end of Week 11. 

Students will also maintain access to these modules after graduation, and can use them to continue their studies post-course, prepare for job interviews, etc.

If you'd like to check these out, they are now available in your MyGA Dashboard.

## Option B: Project Using New Stack/Technology

If you decide not to complete one of the capstone modules on MyGA:

The capstone modules are completely optional if you decide to wait until after graduation to complete them. 

Instead you could build a new project and can use any stack. You have to include at least one new piece of technology such as a new 3rd party API, CSS framework … etc. 

Some students might decide to learn a whole new language like Python of Frontend Framework like Angular or Vue.
