# Project Three: A MERN Stack Application As a Team:

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date.

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work in a small team on a project.**

You and your teammates together will architect, design, and collaboratively build a full-stack web app.

**This project will push you both technically and collaboratively!**

You'll likely be working as part of a team in the workplace and **this project will provide you with that important team development experience.**

However, working on a project as part of a team can be more challenging due to logistical reasons, differing opinions, etc.

During this project, your instructors are going to be evaluating **your ability to listen to and respect other opinions; to share and contribute your ideas with the team; and form a consensus and compromise when opinions differ**.

In fact, **your ability to work in a team during this project is more important to your instructors than the project itself**.

## Planning & Presentation Requirements

Working in a team is going to require more upfront planning to ensure the team is "on the same page"...

<br>
<br>
<br>


#### Pitch Deck

☐ **Pitch your project** to the class with a [pitch deck](https://pitchdeck.improvepresentation.com/what-is-a-pitch-deck) that includes:

- The application name.
- Your team members and their roles.
- The problem you are going to solve with your app.
- Check out previous decks: [Meal Ticket](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsBuC-a_AZ1yXJEE-EbptPIdgj1MktiNALyQyhaFfrM/edit#slide=id.p), [Tripio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gvOypLc4VjKqJzdAW68iwh28uGDSH4Sp1KnA5grDo2g/edit#slide=id.p)[Pantry](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvHoN5MNaRembgcoog5p0GtivVCOZSzvfPyeevzy08g/edit), [ArtWorld](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yGy2Mh3n6IhPxFu4XKnnMtPPi4OGFPpf-Z_TMYw6wQY/edit#slide=id.g7ba109823e_2_7)


<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Trello Board

- A **[Trello](https://trello.com/) board** with:
    
    ☐ **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following 
      three lists in your board:<br>
      	- **Ice Box**<br>
      	- **Current/MVP**<br>
      	- **Completed**<br>
      <br>**User Stories** must follow the following template:<br>**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.
      <br><br>Note: Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish 
      list" stories at the bottom.
    
    ☐ **Wireframes of the main pages of functionality**, e.g. Landing Page, Posts Index Page, Favorite Posts Page, Add Post Page, etc.
    
    ☐ An **ERD** showing the attributes of each entity and the relationships between them. Refer to the Data Modeling lesson for assistance.

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Presentations

**Your entire team must participate in the presentation of the project.**

You will have approximately 15 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**

	☐ Intro your project by paraphrasing the README.
	
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

	☐ Launch the project by clicking the link in the README.
	
	☐ Sign up a new user, then immediately log out.
	
	☐ Log in with your preferred user and demonstrate the features of the app.
	
	☐ Be sure to demo all CRUD data operations.
	
3. **Show/discuss your code:**

	☐ Show the "main" data entity/model.
	
	☐ Show your favorite component.
	
4. **Share the experience:**

	☐ What was your biggest challenge? (besides Team Git Workflow)
	
	☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
	
5. **Q & A + Feedback**


<br>
<br>
<br>


#### 2) Project Source Control & README

The project's source code must be hosted on a personal **GitHub repository**.

The repo is to contain **frequent commits** dated from the beginning of the project through its completion.

The project must include a **`README.md`** file with the following sections:

- **Introduction**: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

- **Technologies Used**: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

- **Getting Started**: Links to the project's planning (Trello board)  and the **deployed app** on Heroku.

- **Unsolved Problems**: List any unsolved issues.

- **Future Enhancements**: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.


<br>
<br>
<br>


#### 3) Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

- A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

- Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**:
	- MongoDB/Mongoose
	- Express
	- React
	- Node

- **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

- Implement token-based **authentication**.  Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

- Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

- **Have a comprehensive feature-set**. For example, **if the app does not include full-CRUD** data operations, **ensure the addition** of one or more of the following:
	
	- Consume a third-party API.
	- Include _admin_ features.
	- Utilize multi-user, real-time communications (difficult and time consuming)


<br>
<br>
<br>


#### 4) Project Presentation

You will have 10 minutes to present and demonstrate the following:

1. Introduce your project by paraphrasing its README.

2. Click the link in the README to open the deployed app on Heroku.

3. Demonstrate the application's authentication features by signing up a new user, logging out that user, then logging in with your preferred user.

4. Demonstrate your app's main features.

5. Share/discuss the following code (not line-by-line):

	- The main/central Mongoose model
	- Your "favorite" Express controller method
	- Your "favorite" React component
	- The client-side routing

6. Share the experience by answering the following:

	- What was your biggest challenge?
	- What are your key learnings/takeaways?

Following your presentation, there will be a brief Q & A period and optional instructor feedback.

## Project Assistance

- At this stage of SEIR, being able to find the the answers to your development issues is of paramount importance. 

- Feel free to use all resources available and collaborate with others.

- If you do seek assistance in Slack, explain the issue, include screenshots, and explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Suggestions to Get Started

- Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features – simple is better. Favor fewer features that look/feel impressive over numerous clunky/sloppy features.

- Implement the `User` model and authentication first. Then implement the "As a visitor, when I browse to the app, I want..." user story.

- Prioritize user stories and code them accordingly.

- When implementing a feature, think through the steps that it takes in plain language first. If necessary, write and/or diagram the steps to help guide your coding.

- Follow the steps we've done in class to implement features, beginning with the user's interaction, identifying the proper route, etc. 

- Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use.

## Best Practices

-  **Write DRY code.**

- In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX.  Build **RESTful APIs to CRUD your data entities (resources)** and perform other functionality via AJAX.  In a React app, those AJAX calls should be made from "service" modules, not components.

- **Be consistent** with your code style.

- **Clearly name variables and functions** - remember, variables are usually named as **nouns** and functions as **verbs**.

- **Write well-formatted HTML/CSS/JS.** Properly formatting your code makes it more readable. Improperly formatted code infers sloppiness.

- **Comment your code where it makes sense**. Most code is self-documenting, however, comments help explain complicated code.

- If you have any questions regarding these requirements, please feel free to contact your instructional team!
