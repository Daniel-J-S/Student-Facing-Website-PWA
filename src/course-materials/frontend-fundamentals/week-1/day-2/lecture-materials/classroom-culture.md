## Communication Tools

### Slack

#### 7 channels

	- #seir_ec_9-7_classroom
	- #seir_ec_9-7_help
	- #seir_ec_9-7_homework
	- #seir_ec_9-7_outcomes
	- #seir_ec_9-7_random

	- #seir_ec_9-7_resources
	
	

<br>
<br>

#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the classroom slack channels:

	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/TAs use this)

<br>
<br>

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately

<br>
<br>

##### Other:

	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (e.g. Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

<br>
<br>

### Zoom

Our video conferencing tool!

- Share video always during class time
- We use breakout rooms for group meetings
- Don't forget to mute!
- You can share your screen with us / anyone
