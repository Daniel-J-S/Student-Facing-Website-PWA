## What are we building?

This resource is meant to provide students with more practice working with React concepts such as state, props, hooks and components by adding an additional feature to the game ... a functional Game Timer. 

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Here's our User Story:

**(AAU)** *"As a User, I should be able to see a ticking timer when the app loads to keep track of how long it takes me to crack the secret code."*


<br>
<br>
<br>

### Considerations before getting started - how do we Integrate this Feature?

So, before implementing this new feature we need to make some consideration as to how we should approach it.

**In the context of implementing a game timer, we need to ask ourselves questions like:**

- How will we represent time in our application?
- Should we store the value of time in state?
- Should we create a seperate piece of state to store time or should we combine it with existing state?
- What should we name this piece of state? ... "`elapsedTime`"?
- How should we increment `elapsedTime`?
- How often or *(by which interval)* should we update `elapsedTime`, ... every second? ... minute?
- What type of data should we use to represent elapsed time? ... a string? ... a number?
- Should we consider if we might want to start/stop the timer? 
- How do we toggle a timer from **"timing"** to **"not timing"**?
- Should we store an additional piece of state to represent whether or not the timer is timing?
- What should we name that piece of state? ... `isTiming`?
- What type of data should we use to represent `isTiming`? ... a string? a boolean?

<br>
<br>
<br>

**What did we come up with?**

After all considerations made, the approach we decided to take is as follows:

**Step 1:** We're going to add two additional pieces of state, to our existing `gameState` object inside of `App.js`.
  
 1. **`elapsedTime`** - *What we'll use to keep track of total time elapsed as a `Number` in seconds.*
 1. **`isTiming`** - *What we'll use to represent whether or not the timer is timing as a `Boolean`.*


**Why are we adding these two properties to existing state?**

*This choice was made because the game timer is part of a game instance ... in other words, the timer is part of the information representing our game performance, so it only makes sense to manage `elapsedTime` with other game-related pieces of state.*

<br>

This is what our refactored `gameState` object should be initialized to:

```javascript
{
    guesses: [getNewGuess()],
    code: genCode(numColors),
    difficulty,
    elapsedTime: 0,
    isTiming: true
}
```

<br>
<br>


**Step 2:** We'll create a helper function called `handleTimerUpdate`; this function is responsible for invoking our `setGameState` setter function and updating existing state with new state with the `elapsedTime` value incremented by one second.

**Step 3:** We'll pass the `handleTimerUpdate` helper function, `elapsedTime` and `isTiming` to our `<GameTimer>` component as props so we can visualize *(render)* changes to the data there.

**Step 4:** We need a custom formatter function to convert total seconds from our `elapsedTime` prop to minutes and seconds.

**Step 5:** This is where we set up the logic of the `<GameTimer>` component. We'll use a `useEffect` hook to initialize a timer object instance created by `setInterval`. This method will be used to repeatedly call our timer update function on a fixed delay [as described here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval). We'll also use the `useEffect` hook to perform a clean up of our `interval` object whenever the component is unmounted from the DOM to prevent causing a memory leak ... more on this later.




<br>
<br>
<br>

## Step 1: Add our new pieces of state:

Alright let's go ahead and update our `getInitialState` function to also initialize the two pieces of state we need for our game timer:

```javascript
// inside the App function Component inside App.js

 function getInitialState(numColors = 4, difficulty = 'Easy') {
    return {
      guesses: [getNewGuess()],
      code: genCode(numColors),
      difficulty,
      elapsedTime: 0,
      isTiming: true
    };
  }
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Step 2: Create our helper function for updating state

For this step we need to write a function we can use to update only the `elapsedTime` property of our `gameState`.

As we remember, the setter function we get from our `useState` hook **replaces** existing state with new state, so let's see how we can address this.

```javascript
// inside the App function Component inside App.js
    function handleTimerUpdate() {
      // the useState gives us an alternate pattern for setting state using previous state
      // with this syntax we pass a callback into the setter function
      setGameState(prevGameState => ({
      // ... which will receive previous state as it's argument
        ...prevGameState,
        // we can then unpack previous state with the spread syntax and just update only what we need
        elapsedTime: prevGameState.elapsedTime + 1
        // in this case, only elapsed time gets updated
      }))
    }
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

Interesting huh? This syntax and behavior it produces [is well documented here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) in the ReactJS docs.

In this example, we're passing in a callback function to `useState` instead of the new state.

There's a lot of power in this new pattern as it allows us to access previous state, so we can update the values we need and leave the remaining value intact.

This is important because the `useState` setter function replaces state with whatever we pass to it. So, without this nifty callback pattern, we have to copy the entire state object, update the properties we need to and then pass the new object into the setter function.


<br>
<br>
<br>

## Step 3: Pass and render our props!

Here's one of the easier parts, lets pass our data: `elapsedTime`, `isTiming` and `handleTimerUpdate` as props to our `<GameTimer>` component.

<br>


**To do this, we'll need to first pass these props through our `<GamePage>` component:**

```jsx
// inside App.js
  <GamePage
    winTries={winTries}
    colors={colors[gameState.difficulty]}
    selColorIdx={selColorIdx}
    guesses={gameState.guesses}
    setColorIdx={setColorIdx}
    handleNewGameClick={handleNewGameClick}
    handlePegClick={handlePegClick}
    handleScoreClick={handleScoreClick}
    {/* new stuff below ðŸ‘‡ */}
    handleTimerUpdate={handleTimerUpdate} 
    elapsedTime={gameState.elapsedTime}
    isTiming={gameState.isTiming}
  />
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


**Next, we'll drill those props down to our `<GameTimer>` component:**

```jsx
// inside`GamePage.js` 
<GameTimer 
  elapsedTime={props.elapsedTime}
  isTiming={props.isTiming}
  handleTimerUpdate={props.handleTimerUpdate}
/>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


**This is what our `<GameTimer>` component should look like right now:**

```jsx
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';

const GameTimer = (props) => (
  <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
    00:00
  </div>
);

export default GameTimer;
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Replace the hard-coded timer with the actual `elapsedTime` prop we passed down from `App.js`.**

```jsx
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';

const GameTimer = (props) => (
  <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
    {props.elapsedTime}
  </div>
);

export default GameTimer;

```

<br>
<br>
<br>


**Following that change, our timer should look like this ...**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hOlYkVs.png" alt="screenshot" />

<br>
<br>
<br>

To make this single `0` value look like an actual timer, we'll need a helper function that formats `elapsedTime`; we'll take care of this next.


<br>
<br>
<br>



## Step 4 Write a helper function for formatting time

**Here's our helper function for taking seconds as an argument and converting them into minutes and seconds.**

```javascript
function formatTime(seconds) {
  const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const secs = (seconds % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  return `${mins}:${secs}`;
}
```
<br>
<br>

To organize our code, we'll export this function from a service module for special utility functions like this.

<br>
<br>

**Let's create a directory inside of `src` called `services`:**

```bash
mkdir src/services
```

<br>
<br>

**Then, inside of `services/` we'll create a file called `utilities.js`:**

```bash
touch src/services/utilities.js
```

<br>
<br>

**Export the formatter function from `utilities.js`**

```javascript
// inside of utilties.js

export function formatTime(seconds) {
  const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const secs = (seconds % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  return `${mins}:${secs}`;
}
```


<br>
<br>

**Now, let's import this function inside of `GameTimer.js`**

```jsx
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';
import { formatTime } from '../../services/utilities';

const GameTimer = (props) => (
  <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
    {props.elapsedTime}
  </div>
);

export default GameTimer;
```

<br>
<br>

**Next, we'll replace `{props.elapsedTime}`, with a call to `formatTime` passing the value `props.elapsedTime` as an argument.**

```jsx
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';
import { formatTime } from '../../services/utilities';

const GameTimer = (props) => (
  <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
    {formatTime(props.elapsedTime)}
  </div>
);

export default GameTimer;

```


<br>
<br>
<br>

**Awesome! We should have what looks like a timer now!**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6d2d0jy.png" alt="screenshot" />

<br>
<br>

**Now we're left with the fun part: Programming the game timer to tick!**

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Step 5: Setting up our Game Timer Logic

Lets set up a local helper function inside of `GameTimer.js` to invoke `props.handleTimerUpdate` every second. 


<br>

**This step involves refactoring the `<GameTimer>` component from the implicit return syntax to the explicit return syntax:**


```jsx
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';
import { formatTime } from '../../services/utilities';

const GameTimer = (props) => {
  
  // here's our helper function
  function handleTick() {
    props.handleTimerUpdate();
  }

  /* 
    we need to an explicit return statement 
    to allow for addition logic in the function body
  */

  return (
    <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
      {formatTime(props.elapsedTime)}
    </div>
  );
}

export default GameTimer;
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

All we need to do is to call our helper function with a 1 second delay as soon as the GameTimer is mounted to the DOM. To accomplish this, we'll use the [`setInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) function that comes with the web browser. 

<br>
<br>

**This function takes a callback and a delay value for arguments to create a "timer interval" object in your browser's memory**

```javascript
setInterval(callback, delay);
```

<br>
<br>

**In our case, we could configure `setInterval` to call our helper function with a 1000 millisecond delay like this:**

```javascript
setInterval(handleTick, 1000);
```

<br>
<br>

Using `setInterval` comes with concerns though ...

If we're not careful, we can create multiple timer objects in the browser as a result of `<GameTimer>` being mounted and unmounted multiple times in one session.

We don't want this to happen as it could lead to a memory leak and other performance-related issues.

The solution is to clean up/destroy this timer object whenever the `<GameTimer>` component is unmounted from the DOM.


Fortunately, the `setInterval` function returns a reference we can use to essentially "clear" the object from memory using another browser function called ... `clearInterval`.

```javascript

// create the timer
const timerId = setInterval(handleTick, 1000);

// clear the timer from memory
clearInterval(timerId);

```

<br>
<br>
<br>

Now that we know how to make our timer tick, and how to clear the timer from memory, let's bring this all together in our project.

As a side effect of the React mounting the component, we need to set and the clear the interval at the right phases within the component lifecycle.

<br>
<br>

### What is the Component Lifecycle?

[The concept of component lifecycle](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) originally came along with Class-Based components and it described the various phases of how React mounts components, updates them whenever state changes, and then removes (unmounts) components. This was a very powerful concept because it allowed developers to **"hook"** their own code into these different phases using something known as [Lifecycle Methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle). 


So, in the beginning, Lifecycle Methods were important to understand because they allowed developers to perform side effects during different lifecycle phases such as fetching data from an API, showing or removing content, or subscribing to 3rd party services that enable additional functionality.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kkHX7CA.png" alt="screenshot">

<br>
<br>

Prior to React Hooks **(React v16.8)**, we disregarded the concept of component lifecycle for function components because it was a feature reserved exclusively for Class-Based Components ... **until now ...**

With the addition of React Hooks, the `useEffect` hook provides *"component lifecycle behavior"* to function components! This means we can perform side effects when function components are first mounted to the DOM, updated and even unmounted from the DOM! Keep in mind, hooks were a huge change for React and there's so much more to learn about what they bring to the table.


Alright, let's look over how we'll use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects in our `<GameTimer>` component:


<br>
<br>

**Here's the side effects we'll perform**

- Component Mounted - **Set the timer interval in browser memory.**
- Component Updated - _No action needed, let React re-render the component with the updated time value._
- Component Un-mounted from DOM and Destroyed - **Clear the interval from memory.**

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Let's import the `useEffect` hook inside of `GameTimer.js` and have it call our `handleTick` helper function on a 1 second delay interval**

```jsx
// import the useEffect hook as a named Import
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';
import { formatTime } from '../../services/utilities';

const GameTimer = (props) => {
  
  
  function handleTick() {
    props.handleTimerUpdate();
  }

  // set up useEffect to set the interval when the component is mounted
  useEffect(() => {
    // call the setInterval function ðŸ‘‡ passing in the handleTick callback and time delay value
    const timerId = setInterval(handleTick, 1000);
   /* 
      the useEffect callback 
      also returns a cleanup function ðŸ‘‡ 
      we can use to invoke the cleanup behavior
    */
   return () => clearInterval(timerId) // ðŸ‘ˆ clear the timer interval once component is destroyed
  }, []); /* ðŸ‘ˆ empty dependency array 
              to prevent side effect from running 
              on every re-render after updating state
            */

  
  return (
    <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
      {formatTime(props.elapsedTime)}
    </div>
  );
}

export default GameTimer;

```

<br>
<br>

**Great! You should have a ticking timer now! ðŸŽ‰**

... but now there's one small problem, if you open your JS console in the browser, you should see this error:

```shell
â–º react_devtools_backend.js:2430 src/components/GameTimer/GameTimer.js
Line 26:6:  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'handleTick'. Either include it or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

<br>

This is a real head scratcher, because it's totally unexpected. ðŸ¤”

**Let's evaluate what's happening in React:**

1. `GameTimer` mounts and `useEffect` runs our `handleTick` helper function on a 1 second delay interval.
2. `handleTick` calls `props.handleTimerUpdate`, which updates our `gameState.elapsedTime` to `gameState.elapsedTime + 1`
3. State was changed, so React re-renders the components.
4. `<GameTimer>` was re-rendered and even though our `setInterval` timer remembers which function it should call back to ... **(`handleTick`)**, the `useEffect` hook does not remember anything from the previous render, including the previous "version" of `handleTick` from the previous render.
5. This results in some really odd behavior such as `useEffect` telling us that `handleTick` should be marked as a dependency and added to the dependency array.


So, in other words, a new `handleTick` function is created every time `<GameTimer>` is re-rendered but `setInterval` is still calling the original callback from the first render ðŸ¤¯. This might seem very confusing ... *because it is* ðŸ¤£.., and you're probably wondering why this is so important as our timer seems to be working perfectly fine. There's a lot to unpack here, and for the record, this strange behavior is by design. This issue has a lot to do with the declarative programming model of React clashing with the imperative programming model of `setInterval`. Fortunately, this anomaly is well explained by one of the most highly regarded experts on the React team, Dan Abramov. He explains all of this and more in his article titled [*"Making setInterval Declarative with React Hooks"*](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/). 

*By the way, this is a really big article, so the section for inspiration is available* [here](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/#refs-to-the-rescue)


In the article, Dan recommends solving this problem by creating a mutable reference to our`handleTick` function with the `useRef` hook. We can dynamically update this reference to the latest version of `handleTick` each time the component re-renders.

The secret sauce to `useRef` is that it gives us a mutable reference we can persist between renders, which is the perfect tool for addressing this issue.

We'll also need another side effect to handle the dynamic updating of the reference between renders; we'll accomplish this using another call to the `useEffect` hook.

<br>
<br>

**Here's what the final refactor should look like:**

```jsx
// import useRef to create a mutable reference
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import styles from './GameTimer.module.css';
import { formatTime } from '../../services/utilities';

const GameTimer = (props) => {
  
  // initialize our mutable reference
  const callbackRef = useRef()
  
  function handleTick() {
    props.handleTimerUpdate();
  }


  useEffect(() => {
  /* 
    update our mutable reference to the latest version of handleTick
    whenever the component re-rendersðŸ‘‡
  */
    callbackRef.current = handleTick;
  }); // ðŸ‘ˆ no dependency array - run this side effect on each render


  useEffect(() => {
  // update the interval callbackðŸ‘‡ to call the saved reference we set up instead
    const timerId = setInterval(callbackRef.current, 1000);
   return () => clearInterval(timerId)
  }, []);

  
  return (
    <div className={styles.GameTimer}>
      {formatTime(props.elapsedTime)}
    </div>
  );
}

export default GameTimer;

```

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Success! ðŸŽ‰ we should have a functioning timer with no weird dependency issues - Congratulations!**


<br>
