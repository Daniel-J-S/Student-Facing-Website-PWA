# Week 2 - Day 2

#### Django URLs, Views, Templates & Models

- [**Activity:** Introduce Project 4](/unit-projects/unit-four-project-requirements) 
- [**Lecture:** Django URLs, Views & Templates](/second-language/week-2/day-2/lecture-materials/django-urls-views-and-templates/)
- [**Lecture:** Intro to Django Models](/second-language/week-2/day-2/lecture-materials/intro-to-django-models/)

- **Lab:** _The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except you'll collect something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever._

<br>
<br>

_The final version of your "Finch Collector" project will be a deliverable._

_Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should push it to your personal GitHub account._
