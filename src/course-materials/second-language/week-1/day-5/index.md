<br>
_The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except you'll collect something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever._

_The final version of your "Finch Collector" project will be a deliverable._

_Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should **create it outside of the class repo** so that you can make it a repo in your personal GitHub account._
