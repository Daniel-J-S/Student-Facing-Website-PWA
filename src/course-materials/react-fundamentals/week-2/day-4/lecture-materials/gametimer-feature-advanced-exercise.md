# Advanced Exercise: Game Timer Feature 


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Roadmap

- Set Up
- What we're building?
- Building the React App's Production Code
- Code the Express App
- Deployment
- Essential Questions

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Set Up

The starter code is the React Mastermind app from the completed React Router Lab.

- Download the <a href="/downloads/react_fundamentals/gametimer-feature/react-mastermind.zip" download>Starter Code</a>
- Extract the folder from the `.zip` file and `cd` into it
- Install the Node modules: `$ npm i`
- Open the code in VS Code: `$ code .`
- Start the dev server: `$ npm start`

<br>
<br>
<br>

Once you run the React Dev Server, you should see the following Screen:

You'll also notice we have a functional Difficulty Screen as Well:

## What are we building?

This resource is meant to provide students with more practice working with React concepts such as state, props, hooks and components by adding an additional feature to the game ... a functional Game Timer. 

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Here's our User Story:

**(AAU)** *"As a User, I should be able to see a ticking timer when the app loads to keep track of how long it takes me to crack the secret code."*


<br>
<br>
<br>

### Considerations before getting started - how do we Integrate this Feature?

So, before implementing this new feature we need to make some consideration as to how we should approach it.

**In the context of implementing a game timer, we need to ask ourselves questions like:**

- How will we represent time in our application?
- Should we store the value of time in state?
- Should we create a seperate piece of state to store time or should we combine it with existing state?
- What should we name this piece of state? ... "`elapsedTime`"?
- How should we increment `elapsedTime`?
- How often or *(by which interval)* should we update `elapsedTime` every ... millisecond? ... second? ... minute?
- What type of data should we use to represent elapsed time ... a string? ... a number?
- Should we consider if we might want to start/stop the timer? 
- How do we toggle a timer from **"timing"** to **"not timing"**?
- Should we store an additional piece of state to represent whether or not the timer is timing?
- What should we name that piece of state? ... `isTiming`?
- What type of data should we use to represent `isTiming`? ... a string? a boolean?

<br>
<br>
<br>

**What did we come up with?**

After all considerations made, the approach we decided to take is as follows:

**Step 1:** We're going to add two additional pieces of state, to our existing `gameState` object inside of `App.js`.
  
 1. **`elapsedTime`** - *What we'll use to keep track of total time elapsed as a `Number` in seconds.*
 1. **`isTiming`** - *What we'll use to represent whether or not the timer is timing as a `Boolean`.*


**Why are we adding these two properties to existing state?**

*This choice was made because the game timer is part of a game instance ... in other words, the timer is part of the game, so it only makes sense to manage with the other game-related pieces of state.*

<br>

- So, this is what our `gameState` object should be initialized to:

```javascript
{
    guesses: [getNewGuess()],
    code: genCode(numColors),
    difficulty,
    elapsedTime: 0,
    isTiming: true
}
```

<br>
<br>


**Step 2:** We'll create a helper function called `handleTimerUpdate` responsible for invoking our `setGameState` setter function and updating existing state with new state with the `elapsedTime` value incremented by one second.

**Step 3:** We'll pass the `handleTimerUpdate` helper function, `elapsedTime` and `isTiming` to our `<GameTimer>` component so we can visualize changes to that data there.

**Step 4:** This is where we set up the logic of the `<GameTimer>` component. We'll use a `useEffect` hook to initialize the timer object instance created by `setInterval`. This method will be used to repeatedly call our timer update function on a fixed delay [as described here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval). We'll also use the `useEffect` hook to perform a clean up of our `interval` object whenever the component is unmounted from the DOM to prevent causing a memory leak ... more on this later.

**Step 5:** We'll also need to build a custom time formatter function to convert total seconds passed to minutes and seconds.


<br>
<br>
<br>

## Step 1: Add our new pieces of state:

Alright let's go ahead and update our `getInitialState` function to also initialize the two pieces of state we need for our game timer:

```javascript
// inside the App function Component inside App.js

 function getInitialState(numColors = 4, difficulty = 'Easy') {
    return {
      guesses: [getNewGuess()],
      code: genCode(numColors),
      difficulty,
      elapsedTime: 0,
      isTiming: true
    };
  }
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Step 2: Create our helper function for updating state

For this step we need to write a function we can use to update only the `elapsedTime` property of our `gameState`.

As we remember, the setter function we get from our `useState` hook **replaces** existing state with new state, so let's see how we can address this.

```javascript
// inside the App function Component inside App.js
    function handleTimerUpdate() {
      // the useState gives us an alternate pattern for setting state using previous state
      // with this syntax we pass a callback into the setter function
      setGameState(prevGameState => ({
      // ... which will receive previous state as it's argument
        ...prevGameState,
        // we can then unpack previous state with the spread syntax and just update only what we need
        elapsedTime: prevGameState.elapsedTime + 1
        // in this case, only elapsed time gets updated
      }))
    }
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

Interesting huh? This syntax and behavior it produces [is well documented here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) in the ReactJS docs.

So, basically what's happening is that we're using the `useState` setter function like we have before only this time we're passing in a callback function instead of the new state.

There's a lot of power in this new pattern as it allows us to access previous state, so we can only worry about updating the values we too and leave the rest intact.

This is important because the `useState` setter function replaces state with whatever we pass to it, so without this nifty callback pattern, we would have needed to make a copy the entire state object first, update the properties we need to and then pass the new object into the setter function when we invoke it.


<br>
<br>
<br>

## Step 3: Pass our props!

Here's one of the easier parts, lets pass our data: `elapsedTime`, `isTiming` and `handleTimerUpdate` as props to our `<GameTimer>` component.

<br>


**To do this, we'll need to first pass these props through our `<GamePage>` component:**

```jsx
// inside App.js
  <GamePage
    winTries={winTries}
    colors={colors[gameState.difficulty]}
    selColorIdx={selColorIdx}
    guesses={gameState.guesses}
    setColorIdx={setColorIdx}
    handleNewGameClick={handleNewGameClick}
    handlePegClick={handlePegClick}
    handleScoreClick={handleScoreClick}
    {/* new stuff below ðŸ‘‡ */}
    handleTimerUpdate={handleTimerUpdate} 
    elapsedTime={gameState.elapsedTime}
    isTiming={gameState.isTiming}
  />
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


**Next, we'll drill those props down to our `<GameTimer>` component:**

```jsx
// inside`GamePage.js` 
<GameTimer 
  elapsedTime={props.elapsedTime}
  isTiming={props.isTiming}
  handleTimerUpdate={props.handleTimerUpdate}
/>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Step 4: GameTimer Component Set up and Logic

Now it's time to program our GameTimer component to perform it's tasks!
